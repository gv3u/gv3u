# The Future of Ryan
Hi there. This is just an update on how I'm doing and where I want to go from here.  
I'm so glad I finally wrote this document and made some updates. This took so much out of me.

## 3/27/22 Update:
Please read my Roblox description.  
I know this isn't the best way to post updates, but I don't really have a good solution for this.  

Also, I've considered reactivating my old Discord account and talking on the CollabVM Discord. I don't want to do that right now, if at all, but I'm just letting you guys know that I've been thinking about it.

## How I'm doing.
I'm doing terrible. I've had a depression at the beginning of 2021 because of all the horrible actions I've taken, but I guess it's slowly going away now since I'm more active on Roblox.  
I kept comparing myself to YandereDev, where I associated myself with writing bad code and generally being an unlikeable person.  

I still have anger issues which you know me well for, and I haven't figured out how to deal with that.  
The anger issues are VERY hard to deal with. Whenever a situation that I don't know how to deal with happens, or when things don't go my way, I just get really upset and have a complete meltdown.  

And now, I have these thoughts that I can't deal with.
* "That's easy! I can do that very easily!"
* "I'm better than that person."

Those thoughts happened recently. I've called them "cocky thoughts". I've had other thoughts too, but I don't want to discuss those.    

I keep forgetting why I'm horrible. I know this is a problem, but I haven't done anything about it. This is why I was sad and felt horrible, because of everything I've done up to this point. I've hurt and insulted so many people, and I keep doing it, but I can't stop, no matter how hard I try.

As for technology in general, I'll still do that here and there. An important thing to note is that I lost interest in that during my depression phase.  

I don't feel like talking to anyone, but I feel like I have to if I don't want to lose my sanity. I don't even want to wake up in the mornings, but I feel like I have to exist. I just browse Reddit, watch YouTube, and play Roblox all day.

If for whatever reason, you still don't know where my Roblox profile is, you can find it [here](https://www.roblox.com/users/34378638/profile).

## Regarding CollabVM.
I'm done with CollabVM. "Windows98_SE" and associated projects will never return, unless I **_really_** feel like rejoining.  
That's why my first Discord account is inactive. I've actually logged into it a few times and you guys kept watching every move I make. When I changed my profile picture, you would immediately point it out. I didn't want to leave because I'll probably never get a chance to come back if I ever want to. That's why I haven't left the CollabVM server and moved to another account.  

And no, 2003ryans.github.io will never return. I heavily regret making that trash site, so much so that I made a holder GitHub account so nobody could make a revival of the site. That violates GitHub's rules, so I deleted that account.

## Regarding the wwrecking Roblox account.
That account is now permanently inactive. I've made some updates to it today, but hopefully that's the last time I ever log into that horrible account.  
You can learn more about what wwrecking was and why I don't like it [here](https://gitlab.com/gv3u/wwrecking-archive).  
You can find the wwrecking account [here](https://roblox.com/users/23312/profile).  
Yes, I know it's on GitLab, but I've started that repository since early 2020, and I'm too lazy to migrate it to GitHub. Plus, I think people are still watching this GitHub account.

It's honestly a miracle that I haven't been terminated from Roblox yet. I've done SO many horrible things, but I'm still here.

## Where I want to go from here.
I want to be in my own world, where nobody can bother me. I want to get away from Earth and the universe, and just live in my own world. I still want to be able to interact with Discord, YouTube, Roblox, etc.  
As for my hobbies, I've been wanting to do game design, but I haven't actually made anything. I've written down my ideas on private Google Docs, but I haven't drawn any art or made anything.  

I'm still active on Roblox now. You'll mostly see me playing Flood Escape 2 or Natural Disaster Survival.
